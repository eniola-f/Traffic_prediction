# Traffic_prediction

Traffic congestion is rising in cities around the world. Contributing factors include expanding urban populations, aging infrastructure, inefficient 
and uncoordinated traffic signal timing and a lack of real-time data.

This project aims to preict the time of day at which certain junctions are congested based on their historical data from 2015 - 2017.
